This repo has been depreciated and replaced. I've written a new version script with a number of improvements. You can find it [in this repo](https://github.com/goose-ws/bash-scripts), it is the [sonarr-group-notifications.bash](https://github.com/goose-ws/bash-scripts/blob/main/sonarr-group-notifications.bash) file (and also the [.env file](https://github.com/goose-ws/bash-scripts/blob/main/sonarr-group-notifications.env.example)).
